## Slide 2: Project Overview

The NaiSmart SACCO Management System is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to digitize and streamline the operations of Savings and Credit Cooperative Organizations (SACCOs) in the transportation sector, specifically focusing on matatu SACCOs in Nairobi.

This system addresses key challenges in traditional SACCO management by providing digital tools for fleet management, route planning, staff management, booking services, performance tracking, and financial reporting.

### Key Features:
- Multi-role user system (Admin, Employee, Passenger)
- Fleet and route management
- Booking system for passengers
- Performance tracking for employees
- Financial management and reporting
- Secure authentication and authorization

## Slide 3: Problem Statement

### Challenges in Traditional SACCO Management

1. **Manual Record Keeping**
   - Paper-based systems prone to loss and damage
   - Difficult to maintain accurate financial records
   - Time-consuming data retrieval and reporting

2. **Lack of Transparency**
   - Members have limited visibility into SACCO operations
   - Difficulty in tracking financial transactions
   - Limited accountability in fund management

3. **Inefficient Fleet Management**
   - No real-time tracking of vehicles and routes
   - Difficulty in scheduling and route optimization
   - Limited maintenance tracking for vehicles

4. **Payment and Booking Issues**
   - No centralized booking system for passengers
   - Cash-based transactions with no digital record
   - Difficulty in fare collection and commission tracking

5. **Performance Monitoring Challenges**
   - No systematic way to track employee performance
   - Limited data for decision-making
   - Difficulty in identifying top-performing routes and drivers

### Need for Digital Transformation

The transportation sector in Nairobi, particularly matatu SACCOs, requires digital solutions to:
- Improve operational efficiency
- Enhance transparency and accountability
- Provide better services to passengers
- Enable data-driven decision making

### Component Interactions

1. **User Authentication Flow**
   - Users access the system through web interfaces
   - Flask server handles authentication requests
   - User credentials are verified against the database
   - Authenticated sessions are managed by Flask-Login

2. **Data Management Flow**
   - CRUD operations are handled by Flask routes
   - SQLAlchemy ORM translates requests to database queries
   - Database stores and retrieves all system data
   - Results are formatted and sent back to the client

3. **Business Logic Processing**
   - Performance calculations are done server-side
   - Booking validations are processed before confirmation
   - Payment calculations follow predefined business rules
